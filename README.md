# codecademy-store
[Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) JavaScript project using [React](https://react.dev/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).

## Codecademy Store
In this project, you’ll build a program that mimics Codecademy’s own online store! The application should display products from the Codecademy store and allow the user to add them to their cart. In the cart, the user can adjust the quantity of each item and the running total will be displayed at the bottom. Lastly, the user can choose the currency for the entire application.

This application has three slices of state:

- inventory: An array of objects representing the items that are available to purchase.
- cart: An object that maps the name of each item added to the cart to an object with the price and desired quantity for that item.
- currencyFilter: A string that represents the currency used to calculate the prices displayed to the user: 'USD', 'CAD' or 'EUR'.

An example of this application’s state might look like this:
```js
state = {
  inventory: [
    { name: 'Hat', img: 'img/hat.png', price: 15.99 },
    { name: 'T-Shirt', img: 'img/t-shirt.png', price: 18.99 },
    { name: 'Hoodie', img: 'img/hoodie.png', price: 49.99 },
  ],
  cart: {
    'Hat': { price: 15.99, quantity: 0 },
    'T-Shirt': { price: 15.99, quantity: 2 },
    'Hoodie': { price: 18.99, quantity: 1 },
  },
  currencyFilter: 'CAD'
}
```
As you will see, the file structure has been organized using the recommended feature-based pattern and most of the inventory and currency features have been built for you. It will be up to you to:

- complete the cart’s action creators and reducer logic
- create the store using createStore() and combineReducers()
- pass the store resources to presentational components via the top-level `<App />` component
- render the `<Cart />` component using the current state data
- dispatch actions to the store

Let’s get started!

## Tasks
### Complete the Redux Logic for the Cart Slice
1. The first step towards completing the cart feature will be to define the actions that can change the state.cart slice, and to handle them in the reducer.

Open up cartSlice.js where you will find the addItem() action creator as well as the reducer cartReducer() which can already handle a 'cart/addItem' action.

In addition to adding items to the cart, the user should be able to modify the quantity of each item in their cart. First, you will need to create an action creator for this kind of action object.

Below the addItem() function:

- Declare a new function called changeItemQuantity
- It should have two parameters: name (a string) and newQuantity (a number)
- It should return an object with two properties: type and payload
- The payload should be an object with a .name and .newQuantity property.
- Export this function.

2.
```js
// Example cart state
cart = {
  'Hat': { price: 15.99, quantity: 0 },
  'T-Shirt': { price: 15.99, quantity: 2 },
  'Hoodie': { price: 18.99, quantity: 1 },
},
```
Great! Now that you know what changeItemQuantity() actions will look like, you can handle them in the cartReducer(). A case for this action type has already been started for you. It first pulls out the name and newQuantity from the payload and grabs the itemToUpdate from the cart.

The first step is to update this item — but you must do it immutably! Below the variable itemToUpdate…

- Declare a new variable called updatedItem and assign to it a new object.
- Copy the contents of itemToUpdate into updatedItem but set the quantity property to the value of newQuantity.

3. The final step is to return the new cart state with updatedItem included.

### Create the Redux Store from Slice Reducers
4. With the reducers and action creators ready to go, it’s time to set up the store.

Open up store.js and, at the top of the file, import the two functions from the 'redux' package used to create the store object: createStore and combineReducers.

5. The store needs a rootReducer to operate but you currently have three separate slice reducers.

For now, start by importing these reducers into the store.js file.

Add three import statements to store.js, one for each of the slice reducers:

- inventoryReducer
- cartReducer
- currencyFilterReducer

6. Now that you have imported all of the resources, you can combine the various slice reducers into a rootReducer using the combineReducers method. Then that rootReducer can be used to create the store object.

- First, call combineReducers() with an object as the argument.
- The object passed to combineReducers() should pair each slice name with the appropriate slice reducer
- Next, pass the entire combineReducers({...}) function call as an argument to createStore().
- Finally, assign the returned value from createStore() to a new variable called store.
- Make sure you export the store!

### Connect Redux to the Top-level React Component
7. Open up the index.js file. This file is known as the “entry point” for the application because it is directly loaded by the index.html file and it is responsible for rendering the top-level `<App />` component.

As you can see, the `<App />` component is already being rendered for you, but it is missing the much-needed data from the store!

At the top of the file, import the store from store.js.

8. With the store imported into index.js, you can now pass its data down to the presentational components via the `<App />` component.

The presentational components will need access to the current state of the store to render the most up-to-date data. They will also need access to the store.dispatch method in order to request new data when the user interacts with the app’s various features.

- Pass the current state of the store as a prop called state to the `<App />` component
- Pass the store.dispatch method as a prop called dispatch to the `<App />` component
- Run your program and you should see the currency buttons rendered at the top of the screen and the text “Sorry, no products are currently available…”.

9. The products are not being rendered yet because the product data is only fetched AFTER the page first loads. If you take a look at src/features/inventory/Inventory.js you will see that this component dispatches a loadData() action upon mounting.

You need to make sure that when any state changes occur, the components are re-rendered with the most up-to-date data.

- At the bottom of index.js subscribe the render function to changes to the state of the store.
- Run your program and you should see the full inventory rendered to the screen!

### Render the Cart Component with Data from the Store
10. Open up App.js and you can see that the `<CurrencyFilter />` and `<Inventory />` presentational components are being rendered with their slice of state data and the dispatch method, but the `<Cart />` component is missing!

Let’s add it in.

- At the top of App.js, import the Cart component from Cart.js.

11. Now, let’s add the `<Cart />` into the `<App />` component’s structure. Like the other two components, the `<Cart />` will need access to its slice of state and the dispatch method. It will also need access to the currencyFilter slice of state to calculate the total cart price.

Inside the App() component’s return statement…

- Add in the `<Cart />` component below the `<Inventory />` component.
- The `<Cart />` component should have three prop values: cart, currencyFilter, and dispatch.

If done correctly, you should see the cart feature rendered to the screen with a total of 0 and the text 'REPLACE_ME" in the place of the item list.

### Use Store Data in the Cart Component
12. Open up Cart.js and take a look at the return statement. Notice that it is trying to render the variable cartElements, which is currently holding the string 'REPLACE_ME'.

Instead, cartElements should be an array of `<li>` elements created using the createCartItem() helper function defined at the bottom of the file.

Recall that the cart slice of state is an object where each key is the name of an item in the cart. Do the following to make the desired cartElements array:

- Initialize cartElements to an empty array.
- Iterate through the keys of the cart object
- For each key, which is the name of an item, call createCartItem() with that item name as an argument.
- Store the values returned by createCartItem() in cartElements.

13. Try adding items to your cart. They now show up! However, there are a few things wrong. Most obviously, the cart total is not showing up properly.

At the top of the Cart.js file, the calculateTotal helper function is imported from the src/utilities/utilities.js file. As the name suggests, you can use this function to calculate the cart’s total!

- Call calculateTotal() with the cart and currencyFilter prop values as arguments and store the result in the variable total.

14. Wonderful! You can now add items to the cart and the total will accurately reflect the cart. However, trying to change the quantity of the items using the number picker doesn’t seem to update the state.

Within the createCartItem() function, take a look at the onChange value. It’s using the onInputChangeHandler() function, passing along the name of the item and the new value of the input field (e.target.value).

Now, take a look at onInputChangeHandler(). After receiving the name and input values and doing some data validation and normalization on the input, it should dispatch a changeItemQuantity() action to the store to update the data.

- At the top of Cart.js, import the changeItemQuantity() action creator that you made earlier in this project.

15. At the end of onInputChangeHandler()…

- Use the dispatch method from the props to dispatch a changeItemQuantity() action with name as the first argument and newQuantity as the second.
- After completing this step, try modifying the quantity using the number input field!

### Extra Challenges
16. Well done! You’ve gone through the entire process of making action creators, setting up a slice reducer, creating the store object, and plugging in the store data into React components. If you’d like to keep working on this project, try implementing this bonus feature:

- Add a search feature (like in the Recipes app) to filter the products shown in the inventory.
